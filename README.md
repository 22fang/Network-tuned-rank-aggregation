# Network-tuned-rank-aggregation
1. cal_diff_kernel.m & diff_kernel.m are used to calculate the diffusion kernel score matrix
2. CGI.m is the program for CGI calculation of each single rank list
3. GR.m is the program for GR calculation of each single rank list
4. endeavour.R is the integration of updated single rank lists into a integrated rank list
5. The Robust rank aggregation integraion is implemented by 'aggregateRanks' command  from the package of http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RobustRankAggreg/index.html
5. web_app.pl is used automatically submit input to a web application and collect the return resutls
